# SNAKE - using PyGame

## About

This is a toy project based on what I learn from ["Python Cookbook"](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Cookbook-Third-David-Beazley/dp/1449340377) & ["Python crash course 2nd edition"](https://khwarizmi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Eric_Matthes_Python_Crash_Course_A_Hands.pdf).

This game is specifically inspired by the first project introduced in "Python crash course".

Please enjoy!
